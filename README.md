I saw [Brian Jenney](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brianjenney?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAFO8pgBDJ7LO5N9gsUNKsIaMRKhyR2HqK4&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_detail_base%3BZQcK0UFET%2BOKscuoXmhMbw%3D%3D)'s post on LinkedIn that he was once asked to make a snake game in an interview
And because I'm nerd I accepted the challenge and made it using HTML, CSS and JavaScript

## Gameplay

- Use arrow keys to move the snake (or use the on-screen buttons)
- Eat the apple to grow and gain points
- You can go through the walls and appear on the other side
- If you hit yourself, you die

## About me

I'm actually a flutter developer, but I want to learn web dev, so I thought this would be a challenge to start with
